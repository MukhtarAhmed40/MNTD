For the preprocessing notebooks (data/preprocess_cicids2017.ipynb and data/preprocess_cira_doh.ipynb), I recommend creating Jupyter notebooks that:

Download the raw datasets

Perform feature extraction as described in the paper

Normalize and preprocess the data

Save in the format expected by the data loader

The notebooks would be dataset-specific and would implement the preprocessing pipeline described in the paper's Section 3.9 (Data Preprocessing).
