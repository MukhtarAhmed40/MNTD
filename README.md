This repository contains the implementation of "MNTD: An Efficient Malicious Network Traffic Detection Framework based on Optimized Deep Learning" as described in the original paper.

## Features

- CNN-BiLSTM with Multi-Head Attention architecture
- Adaptive Weighted Delay Velocity (AWDV) optimization
- Contrastive learning for improved feature discrimination
- Support for CICIDS2017 and CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw2020 datasets
- Comprehensive training and evaluation pipeline

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MNTD-Malicious-Network-Traffic-Detection.git
cd MNTD-Malicious-Network-Traffic-Detection
